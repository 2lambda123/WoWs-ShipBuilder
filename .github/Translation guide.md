# How to help with the translation

You can help us translating the program in your language at https://crwd.in/wows-shipbuilder. This small guide will guide you through the step needed for it.

If your language is not present in the list explained in the first step, join the discord server and send a DM to Yesod30#3558 and ask to add the language to the translations.

## Step to follow

After getting to the site, you will be presented with a list of languages. Select the one you want to translate in.

Select the "WoWs-ShipBuilder / development" folder (should be the only one).

After that, open the folder you see until you reach the Translation.resx file. At this point, if you haven't already made one, it's gonna ask for your account. Either log in or create it to access the translations.

Once you logged in, you should see the following screen. This is where you can help us by inserting the translations. You will also get a list of very helpful tips, so i reccomend reading them instead of skipping them
