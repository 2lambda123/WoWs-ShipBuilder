## Additions

## Changes

## Bugfixes

- Fixed incorrect conversion for some parameters in DefAA and Repair Party consumables.
- Fixed Concealment System Modification 1 not working on squadrons.
- Fixed planes restoration time not being displayed.
- Fixed appcrash when using a file dialog.

## Known Issues

In order to fix the appcrash when using file dialogs, the UI framework needed an update. However, this update broke
cleartype support, resulting in slightly more blurry texts in the application. We are sorry for the inconvenience but there is no other solution available at the moment.
