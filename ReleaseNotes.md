# Update 1.4.5

## Additions

## Changes

## Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug where the app could not create or update its shortcuts on install and update.

## Known Issues

In order to fix the appcrash when using file dialogs, the UI framework needed an update. However, this update broke
cleartype support, resulting in slightly more blurry texts in the application. We are sorry for the inconvenience but there is no other solution available at the moment.

___
To download the program for the first time, you need to download only the Setup.exe file. The other files are used by
the application for automatic updates.
